# Linux Fundamentals
This folder documents my Linux and terminal learning journey for cybersecurity.
All labs and notes here focus on understanding how Linux systems work from a
security and operational perspective.

## Platform Used
- Linux Journey (LabEx)

## Topics Covered
- Linux file system structure
- Basic terminal navigation (ls, cd, pwd)
- File and directory management
- File permissions and ownership
- Basic process awareness

## Why Linux Matters in Cybersecurity
- Most servers run Linux
- Security analysts investigate systems through the terminal
- Attackers commonly operate using Linux environments
- Log analysis and incident response often require Linux knowledge

## Goal
Build strong Linux fundamentals required for blue team and SOC analyst roles.
